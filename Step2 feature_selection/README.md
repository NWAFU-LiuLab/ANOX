#feature_selection.py

#This script is used for feature selection, reducing 1673 features to 1170.

Feature selection is based on the Max-Relevance-Max-Distance (MRMD) algorithm.

Script input: x_1673.txt and y.txt

Script output: x_1170.txt ( If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. )

The output file can be used for model validation in the third step.
